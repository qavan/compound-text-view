<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lndmflngs/compound-text-view/master/art/showcase.png?raw=true" width="50%" />

### Features
* Optimized way to use drawables with TextView

* CompoundViewClickListener

## Download
Download the [latest release][1] or grab via Gradle:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
```
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.qavan:compound-text-view:1.3.3'
}
```

## Usage
The simplest way is to use `CompoundTextView` like a normal `TextView`

```xml
<com.lockwood.compound.CompoundTextView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:paddingStart="16dp"
    android:paddingEnd="16dp"
    app:drawableGravity="center"
    app:drawablePadding="16dp"
    app:drawableStart="@drawable/image"
    app:text="Item" />
```
### Data binding
If you use data binding you can use [this][10] adapter

### Loading images
There are several libraries that follow best practices for loading images. You can use these libraries in your app to load images in the most optimized manner. I recommend Glide, but you can use others: Picasso, Coil.

**Examples**: [Glide][5], [Picasso][6], [Coil][7]

### CompoundTextView Attrs

Attributes | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**drawableTint*** | color | - | Tint for all drawables.
**drawableSize*** | dimension | - | Custom size for all drawables.
**drawablePadding*** | dimension | - | Padding for all drawables.
**drawableGravity*** | integer | Gravity.START or Gravity.TOP | Gravity for all drawables in view.
**drawableStart** | reference | - | Drawable to appear to the start of the view.
**drawableTop** | reference | - | Drawable to appear to the top of the view.
**drawableEnd** | reference | - | Drawable to appear to the end of the view.
**drawableBottom** | reference | - | Drawable to appear to the bottom of the view.
**useCustomTransformation** | boolean | false | Use default or custom transformations for drawables before drawable will be wrapped.
**handleClickWithinDrawableBounds** | boolean | false | Handle clicks on "gravity" space or on drawable itself.

*contains individual attr for each position (eg: drawableStartTint, drawableTopTint and etc.)
